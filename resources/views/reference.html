    <h2>Computation of the Child's Age</h2>
    <p>After verifying the dates, compute the child's age by subtracting the date he was born from the date the test was administered. Each month is composed of 30 days. Do not round off the months or years. Write the examiner's name each time the test is administered.</p>
    <p>It is recommended that the Checklist be administered to the child once a year.</p>

    <h2>Introducing the Checklist</h2>
    <p><strong>Introduce the Checklist to the parent/caregiver by saying the following:</strong></p>
    <p>We are here to help you find out how your child is developing by asking you some questions about the things he is able to do, or by having your child do some activities. There is no pass or fail score. This is just a checklist. Some of the questions are for children older than your child so I do not expect him to be able to do all the things I will be asking.</p>
    <p>We plan to administer this Checklist several times until your child is 6 years old. So please do not teach or coach him because we need to know just what he can and cannot do at this age.</p>
    <p>Later on we will share the results with you and give suggestions on what else you can do to stimulate your child's development.</p>
    
    <p><strong>After rapport has been established, introduce the Checklist to the child by saying the following:</strong></p>
    <p>I will be asking you to do some things for me today. Some of them will be very easy. Some of them may be a little hard for you. Do not worry if you cannot do them all because some of the activities are for children who are a little older than you. So I do not expect you to be able to do everything I ask. Just try your best.</p>
    
    <h2>How to Administer</h2>
    <p>This form can be used for three separate evaluations of the same child so it will be easy for you to see how he is developing as he grows older. The "Present" portion of this Record has three columns where you are to mark the child's skills and behavior each time you assess him. If the child exhibits the skill or behavior, put a check (✔) in the designated column. If the child does not, put a hyphen (-) and write additional information in the "Comments" column explaining why the child was unable to demonstrate the behavior.</p>
    
    <h3>Where to start and stop</h3>
    <p>Administer all the items.</p>
    
    <h3>How to score</h3>
    <p>Tally the number of check marks (✔) in each domain and record this in the section labeled "Total Score."</p>
